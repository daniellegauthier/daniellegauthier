# Hi, I’m Danielle Gauthier 🕯️

**Building interpretable AI systems that translate emotion into measurable impact.**
* Improving sentiment classification accuracy by using Semantic Color Math benchmarks with significant RGB regression anchoring

* Developed 2+ research dashboards for Census/World Bank analysis of accessibility and wellbeing ([1. Anthropocene Census Chloropleths](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/Anthropocene-by-US-County) and [2. World Bank Wellbeing](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/World-Bank-1960-2023))

* Deployed 3+ secure web apps (JS, Python) for wellbeing exploration and analysis ([1. GNH and Color Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/RGB-Root-Matriz-Color-Plotter), [2. DEI and GNH Consulting App](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/La-Matriz-DEI-BI), and [3. Ambient Mood Analyzer](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/chromesthesia))


🔭 **I’m currently working on**

* [Semantic-Color-Math](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/Semantic-Color-Math): a framework that maps language into symbolic color geometries for interpretability, affective computing, and emotional-AI alignment.
* La Matriz API: Flask + PostgreSQL + RAG/Agents powering a decolonial, self-reflective database for policy analysis, wellbeing research, and creative tools.
* Early-stage blockchain prototype (SoulCoin): experimenting with a wellbeing data sovereignty model for collective healing.


👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**

* Research in **AI interpretability, affective computing, and computational social science**.
* Projects at the intersection of **policy analysis, emotional AI, and data sovereignty**.
* Creative tech experiments that use **frameworks for inclusive AI design**.

🤔 **I’m looking for help with**

* Scaling multimodal AI workflows (text + color + geometry).
* Secure deployment pipelines for healing/ritual-centered applications.
* Building partnerships for **interdisciplinary grants, residencies, or policy research**.

💬 **Ask me about**

* Semantic Color Math & La Matriz (bridging poetry, math, and code).
* Emotional-AI alignment & interpretability frameworks.
* Decolonial design, ritual economy, and blockchain for social good.
