# Hi, I’m Danielle Gauthier 🕯️

🔭 **I’m currently working on**

* [Semantic-Color-Math](https://github.com/daniellegauthier/Semantic-Color-Math): a framework that maps language into symbolic color geometries for interpretability, affective computing, and emotional-AI alignment.
* La Matriz API: Flask + PostgreSQL + RAG/Agents powering a decolonial, self-reflective database for policy analysis, wellbeing research, and creative tools.
* Early-stage blockchain prototype (SoulCoin): experimenting with a “ritual economy” for data sovereignty and collective healing.

🌱 **I’m currently learning**

* Backend + cloud systems (Flask, Docker, Kubernetes, OpenShift).
* Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), LangChain, and AI agents.
* Deep learning with PyTorch (sequence modeling, clustering, interpretability).
* Cybersecurity and Rust programming to secure self-reflective databases and blockchain prototypes.

👯 **I’m looking to collaborate on**

* Research in **AI interpretability, affective computing, and computational social science**.
* Projects at the intersection of **policy analysis, emotional AI, and data sovereignty**.
* Creative tech experiments that fuse **art, language, and cyberfeminism**.

🤔 **I’m looking for help with**

* Scaling multimodal AI workflows (text + color + geometry).
* Secure deployment pipelines for healing/ritual-centered applications.
* Building partnerships for **interdisciplinary grants, residencies, or policy research**.

💬 **Ask me about**

* Semantic Color Math & La Matriz (bridging poetry, math, and code).
* Emotional-AI alignment & interpretability frameworks.
* Decolonial design, ritual economy, and blockchain for social good.
